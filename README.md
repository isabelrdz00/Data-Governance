# Riverwood Health Clinic – Data Governance Framework & Plan
## Overview
- This repository contains two key documents developed as part of a Data Governance initiative for a hypothetical case, Riverwood Health Clinic. The documents include:

- **Data Governance Framework** – A strategic guide that outlines the mission, vision, and governance structure required to manage and protect the clinic's data.
- **Data Governance Plan** – A 30, 60, 90-day action plan to implement the data governance framework, ensuring the clinic's data management processes are compliant, secure, and optimized for operational efficiency.

## Documents
### 1. Data Governance Framework
- The Data Governance Framework document sets the foundation for how data will be governed, managed, and protected at Riverwood Health Clinic. It outlines:
  - **Mission & Vision**: The purpose and long-term goals of the data governance initiative.
  - **Scope**: The types of data covered, including clinical, administrative, and patient-related data.
  - **Roles & Responsibilities**: A detailed breakdown of the governance structure, including roles such as the Data Governance Council, Data Owners, Data Stewards, and the IT Department.
  - **Policies & Standards**: Guidelines for maintaining data quality, ensuring security, and adhering to regulatory compliance (e.g., HIPAA).
  - **Governance Structure**: A flowchart that illustrates the hierarchy and responsibilities within the data governance program.

### 2. Data Governance Plan
- The Data Governance Plan is an actionable guide designed to implement the framework within the first 90 days. It provides:
  - **30, 60, 90-Day Plan**: Detailed actions for understanding the current environment, establishing a governance structure, and operationalizing the data governance program.
  - **Roles and Deliverables**: Key stakeholders involved in the governance process and the tasks they are responsible for completing.
  - **Gantt Chart**: A visual timeline showing the progression of deliverables and tasks across the 30, 60, and 90-day periods.
  - **Hierarchy Chart**: A visual representation of roles and responsibilities in the data governance structure.

## Why Data Governance Matters
- In healthcare and any other industry, data governance is crucial for ensuring the privacy, security, and quality of patient data. With increasing amounts of data and regulatory requirements (such as HIPAA), a well-structured governance framework and plan are essential for mitigating risks, ensuring compliance, and improving data-driven decision-making. This initiative demonstrates how healthcare institutions can manage data as a valuable asset while maintaining operational efficiency.
